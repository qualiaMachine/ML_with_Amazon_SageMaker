::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Storing data on AWS
Machine learning and AI projects rely on data, making efficient storage and management essential. AWS provides several options for storing data, each with different use cases and trade-offs. 

> #### Consult your institution's IT before handling sensitive data in AWS
> When using AWS for research, **ensure that no restricted or sensitive data is uploaded to S3 or any other AWS service *unless explicitly approved by your institution’s IT or cloud security team***.
> For projects involving sensitive or regulated data (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, or proprietary research data), consult your institution's cloud security or compliance team to explore approved solutions. This may include encryption, restricted-access storage, or dedicated secure environments. If unsure about data > classification, review your institution's data security policies before uploading.

## Options for storage: EC2 Instance or S3
When working with SageMaker and other AWS services, you have options for data storage, primarily **EC2 instances** or **S3**.

### What is an EC2 instance?
An Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server environment where you can run applications, process data, and store data temporarily. EC2 instances come in various types and sizes to meet different computing and memory needs, making them versatile for tasks ranging from light web servers to intensive machine learning workloads. For example, when you launch a new Jupyter notebook from Sagemaker, this notebook is run on an an EC2 instance configured to run Jupyter notebooks, enabling direct data processing. 

### When to store data directly on EC2
Using an EC2 instance for data storage can be useful for temporary or small datasets, especially during processing within a Jupyter notebook. However, this storage is not persistent; if the instance is stopped or terminated, the data is erased. Therefore, EC2 is ideal for one-off experiments or intermediate steps in data processing.

### Limitations of EC2 storage

- **Scalability**: EC2 storage is limited to the instance’s disk capacity, so it may not be ideal for very large datasets.
- **Cost**: EC2 storage can be more costly for long-term use compared to S3.
- **Data Persistence**: EC2 data may be lost if the instance is stopped or terminated, unless using Elastic Block Store (EBS) for persistent storage.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### What is an S3 bucket?
Storing data in an **S3 bucket** is generally preferred for machine learning workflows on AWS, especially when using SageMaker. An S3 bucket is a container in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) where you can store, organize, and manage data files. Buckets act as the top-level directory within S3 and can hold a virtually unlimited number of files and folders, making them ideal for storing large datasets, backups, logs, or any files needed for your project. You access objects in a bucket via a unique **S3 URI** (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/your-file.csv`), which you can use to reference data across various AWS services like EC2 and SageMaker.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout 

### Benefits of using S3 (recommended for SageMaker and ML workflows)
For flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, store data in S3 and load it into EC2 as needed. This setup allows:  

- **Separation of storage and compute**: The most essential advantage. Data in S3 remains accessible even when EC2 instances are stopped or terminated, reducing costs and improving workflow flexibility.
- **Easy data sharing**: Datasets in S3 are easier to share with team members or across projects compared to EC2 storage.  
- **Integration with AWS services**: SageMaker, Lambda, and other AWS services can read directly from and write back to S3, streamlining ML workflows.  
- **Scalability**: S3 handles large datasets efficiently, enabling storage beyond the limits of an EC2 instance's disk space.  
- **Cost efficiency**: S3 storage is generally lower cost than expanding EC2 disk volumes, and you only pay for the storage you use.  
- **Data persistence**: Unlike EC2 storage, which can be lost if an instance is terminated, S3 ensures long-term data availability.  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Recommended approach: S3 buckets

In order to upload our titanic dataset to an S3 bucket on AWS, we'll follow the below summary procedure (details follow):

1. Log in to AWS Console and navigate to S3.
2. Create a new bucket or use an existing one.
3. Upload your dataset files.
4. Use the object URL to reference your data in future experiments.

### Detailed procedure

##### 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
- Log in to AWS Console using your credentials.


##### 2. Navigate to S3
- Type "S3" in the search bar
- Recommended: Select the star icon to save S3 as a bookmark in your AWS toolbar 
- Select **S3 - Scalable Storage in the Cloud**

##### 3. Create a new bucket
- Click **Create Bucket** and enter a unique name, and note that bucket name must not contain uppercase characters. To easily find this bucket later in our shared AWS account, please use the following naming convention: `yourname-titanic-s3` (e.g., doejohn-titanic-s3).
- **Access Control (ACLs)**: Disable ACLs (recommended).  
	- **What are ACLs?** Access Control Lists (ACLs) define fine-grained permissions at the object level, allowing you to grant specific users or AWS accounts access to individual files in your bucket.  
	- **Why disable them?** AWS now recommends managing access through bucket policies and IAM roles, which offer better security and are easier to manage at scale. Unless you have a specific need for ACLs, disabling them is the best practice.
- **Public Access**: Turn on "Block all public access" (recommended). This setting prevents unauthorized access and accidental data exposure. If you need external access, use IAM policies or signed URLs instead.
- **Versioning**: Disable unless you need multiple versions of objects. Enable only if needed, as versioning increases storage costs. Useful when tracking changes to datasets over time but unnecessary for static datasets.  
- **Tags**: Adding tags to your S3 buckets is a great way to track project-specific costs and usage over time, especially as data and resources scale up. To easily track costs associated with your bucket in our shared AWS account, add the following fields:
	- **Purpose**: titanic-bucket
	- **Owner**: yourname
	![Example of Tags for an S3 Bucket](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/ml-with-aws-sagemaker/main/images/bucket_tags2.png){alt="Screenshot showing required tags for an S3 bucket"}

- Click **Create Bucket** at the bottom once everything above has been configured


##### 4. Edit bucket policy
Once the bucket is created, you'll be brought to a page that shows all of your current buckets (and those on our shared account). We'll have to edit our bucket's policy to allow ourselves proper access to any files stored there (e.g., read from bucket, write to bucket). To set these permissions...

1. Click on the name of your bucket to bring up additional options and settings.
2. Click the Permissions tab
3. Scroll down to Bucket policy and click Edit. Paste the following policy, **editing the bucket name "doejohn-titanic-s3"** to reflect your bucket's name

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::183295408236:role/ml-sagemaker-use"
			},
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:DeleteObject",
				"s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::doejohn-titanic-s3",
				"arn:aws:s3:::doejohn-titanic-s3/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

For workshop attendees, this policy grants the `ml-sagemaker-use` IAM role access to specific S3 bucket actions, ensuring they can use the bucket for reading, writing, deleting, and listing parts during multipart uploads. Attendees should apply this policy to their buckets to enable SageMaker to operate on stored data.

#### General guidance for setting up permissions outside of this workshop
When setting up a bucket outside of this workshop, it's essential to create a similar IAM role (such as `ml-sagemaker-use`) with policies that provide controlled access to S3 resources, ensuring only the necessary actions are permitted for security and cost-efficiency.
 
a. **Create an IAM role**: Set up an IAM role for SageMaker to assume, with necessary S3 access permissions, such as `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, and `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`, as shown in the policy above.
 
b. **Attach permissions to S3 buckets**: Attach bucket policies that specify this role as the principal, as in our bucket policy above
 
c. **More information**: For a detailed guide on setting up roles and policies for SageMaker, refer to the [AWS SageMaker documentation on IAM roles and policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html). This resource explains role creation, permission setups, and policy best practices tailored for SageMaker’s operations with S3 and other AWS services.
 
This setup ensures that your SageMaker operations will have the access needed without exposing the bucket to unnecessary permissions or external accounts.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### 5. Upload files to the bucket
- If you haven't downloaded these files yet (part of workshop setup), right-click and save as .csv:
	- [titanic_train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/ml-with-aws-sagemaker/main/data/titanic_train.csv)
	- [titanic_test.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/ml-with-aws-sagemaker/main/data/titanic_test.csv)
- Navigate to the Objects tab of your bucket, then **Upload**.
- **Add Files** (`titanic_train.csv`, `titanic_test.csv`) and click **Upload** to complete.

##### 6. Take note of S3 URI for your data
- After uploading a file to S3, click on the file to locate its **Object URI** (e.g., s3://doejohn-titanic-s3/titanic_train.csv). The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique address that specifies the location of the file within S3. This URI is essential for referencing data in AWS services like SageMaker, where it will be used to load data for processing and model training.

## S3 bucket costs

S3 bucket storage incurs costs based on data storage, data transfer, and request counts.

### Storage costs
- Storage is charged per GB per month. Typical: Storing 10 GB costs approximately $0.23/month in S3 Standard (us-east-1).
- Pricing Tiers: S3 offers multiple storage classes (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, etc.), with different costs based on access frequency and retrieval times. Standard S3 fits most purposes. 

### Data transfer costs
- **Uploading** data to S3 is free.
- **Downloading** data (out of S3) incurs charges (~$0.09/GB). Be sure to take note of this fee, as it can add up fast for large datasets.
- **In-region transfer** (e.g., S3 to EC2) is free, while cross-region data transfer is charged (~$0.02/GB).

### Request costs
- GET requests are $0.0004 per 1,000 requests. In the context of Amazon S3, "GET" requests refer to the action of retrieving or downloading data from an S3 bucket. Each time a file or object is accessed in S3, it incurs a small cost per request. This means that if you have code that reads data from S3 frequently, such as loading datasets repeatedly, each read operation counts as a GET request.

***To calculate specific costs based on your needs, storage class, and region, refer to AWS's [S3 Pricing Information](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).***

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

### Challenge: Estimating Storage Costs

**1. Estimate the total cost of storing 1 GB in S3 for one month assuming:**

- Storage duration: 1 month
- Storage region: us-east-1
- Storage class: S3 Standard
- Data will be retrieved 100 times for model training and tuning (`GET` requests)
- Data will be deleted after the project concludes, incurring data retrieval and deletion costs

**Hints**

- S3 storage cost: $0.023 per GB per month (us-east-1)
- Data transfer cost (retrieval/deletion): $0.09 per GB (us-east-1 out to internet)
- `GET` requests cost: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests (each model training will incur one `GET` request)
- Check the [AWS S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) page for more details.
 
**2. Repeat the above calculation using the following dataset sizes: 10 GB, 100 GB, 1 TB**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

Using the S3 Standard rate in us-east-1:

1. **1 GB**:  
   - **Storage**: 1 GB * $0.023 = $0.023
   - **Retrieval/Deletion**: 1 GB * $0.09 = $0.09  
   - **GET Requests**: 100 requests * $0.0004 per 1,000 = $0.00004  
   - **Total Cost**: **$0.11304**

2. **10 GB**:  
   - **Storage**: 10 GB * $0.023 = $0.23
   - **Retrieval/Deletion**: 10 GB * $0.09 = $0.90  
   - **GET Requests**: 100 requests * $0.0004 per 1,000 = $0.00004  
   - **Total Cost**: **$1.13004**

3. **100 GB**:  
   - **Storage**: 100 GB * $0.023 = $2.30
   - **Retrieval/Deletion**: 100 GB * $0.09 = $9.00  
   - **GET Requests**: 100 requests * $0.0004 per 1,000 = $0.00004  
   - **Total Cost**: **$11.30004**

4. **1 TB (1024 GB)**:  
   - **Storage**: 1024 GB * $0.023 = $23.55
   - **Retrieval/Deletion**: 1024 GB * $0.09 = $92.16  
   - **GET Requests**: 100 requests * $0.0004 per 1,000 = $0.00004  
   - **Total Cost**: **$115.71004**

These costs assume no additional request charges beyond those for retrieval, storage, and `GET` requests for training.

## Removing unused data (complete *after* the workshop)

After you are done using your data, it's important to practice good resource stewardship and remove the unneeded files/buckets.

**Option 1: Delete data only (if you plan to reuse bucket for other datasets)**

- Go to S3, navigate to the bucket.
- Select files to delete, then **Actions > Delete**.

**Option 2: Delete the S3 bucket entirely (you no longer need the bucket or data)**

- Select the bucket, click **Actions > Delete**.
- Type the bucket name to confirm deletion.

***Please complete option 2 following this workshop***. Deleting the bucket stops all costs associated with storage, requests, and data transfer.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use S3 for scalable, cost-effective, and flexible storage.
- EC2 storage is fairly uncommon, but may be suitable for small, temporary datasets.
- Track your S3 storage costs, data transfer, and requests to manage expenses.
- Regularly delete unused data or buckets to avoid ongoing costs.
