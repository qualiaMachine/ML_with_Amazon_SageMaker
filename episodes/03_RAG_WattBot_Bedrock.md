In the previous episodes you built a basic RAG pipeline for WattBot using a local GPU instance and then an offline SageMaker Processing job. Both approaches gave you full control over the models, but you were responsible for provisioning compute and keeping model versions up to date.

In this episode we move the core model work — **both text embeddings and answer generation** — onto **Amazon Bedrock**. We'll use:

- an **Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2** model to turn WattBot chunks into vectors, and  
- an **Anthropic Claude** model hosted on Bedrock to generate answers and explanations.

The retrieval, evaluation, and WattBot scoring logic are exactly the same as before; we're just
swapping out the underlying models and where they run. This lets you experiment with hosted,
state‑of‑the‑art models without having to manage GPUs or container images yourself.

## Why Bedrock for WattBot?

For the GPU instance and Processing Job episodes, you were responsible for picking a model,
managing versions, and making sure your instance had enough VRAM. That’s fine for experiments,
but it can get painful once multiple teams or challenges want to reuse the same pipeline.

Running your **embedding + generation** steps on Amazon Bedrock gives you a few nice properties:

- **Managed, up‑to‑date models.** You can use high‑quality models from Anthropic, Amazon, and
  others without worrying about container images or CUDA versions.
- **Pay for what you use (in tokens).** Instead of paying for a GPU instance that might sit
  idle, you pay per token (input + output) when you call the model. For some workloads this
  is cheaper; for large offline batches with smaller models, a dedicated GPU can still win.
- **Easier sharing and governance.** It’s easier to standardize on a small set of Bedrock
  models across courses, hackathons, or labs than to manage many separate GPU instances.

In this notebook, we’ll keep the same WattBot training questions and scoring helper you used
before, and we’ll simply move both the **embedding** and **answer/explanation** steps onto
Bedrock-hosted models.


## Setup: what you should already have

This notebook assumes you have already run the earlier WattBot episodes so that:

- the WattBot corpus has been chunked into `chunks.jsonl`
- the WattBot training questions `train_QA.csv` and `metadata.csv` live under a `data/` folder
- (optionally) you have a local embedding file from earlier experiments, e.g. `embeddings.npy`

In this episode we’ll recompute embeddings **using an Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 model
on Bedrock**, and we’ll save those vectors out as `embeddings_bedrock.npy`. That keeps this
notebook self‑contained while still letting you compare against the earlier GPU / Processing
Job runs if you want.


### Models used in this episode

We’ll work with **Amazon Bedrock–hosted foundation models** for both embedding and generation:

- **Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2** (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`)

  - General‑purpose text‑embedding model for semantic search, retrieval, clustering, and classification.
  - Supports configurable embedding dimensions (for example 256–8,192) and has presets tuned for retrieval or binary indexing.
  - AWS does not publish the exact number of parameters for Titan models; you can treat it as a modern transformer specialized for embeddings rather than free‑form text generation. 

- **Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku** (`anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` via Bedrock)

  - A fast, mid‑sized Claude model that balances cost and quality for workloads like RAG, chat, and lightweight analysis.
  - Particularly useful when you want many calls (e.g., one per question) and care about low latency and lower per‑token pricing compared to flagship models such as Claude Opus or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. 
  - Anthropic does not publish exact parameter counts for Claude models; Haiku sits in the “smallest / fastest” tier within the Claude 3 family.

- **(Optional) Multimodal models for tables and figures**

  - Bedrock also exposes **multimodal models** that can reason over images, charts, and document layouts (for example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet with vision, or Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings). These are a good fit if much of your evidence lives in **figures, tables, or scanned PDFs**.
  - To use them from Bedrock you send **both text and image content** in a single request:
      - Pre‑process PDFs by rendering pages (or cropping individual tables/figures) to images using a tool like `pdf2image` or a headless browser.
      - Base64‑encode those images and include them as image parts alongside text in the model request.
      - For multimodal embeddings, you call a Titan multimodal embedding model with an `inputImage` (and optionally `inputText`) payload to obtain a single vector that mixes visual and textual information.
  - This notebook stays with **text‑only** embeddings + generation to keep the workflow simple, but the same RAG pattern extends naturally to multimodal models once you add an image‑extraction step to your preprocessing pipeline.

For a full catalog of available models (including other Claude variants, Amazon models, and partner models), open the **Model catalog** in the Amazon Bedrock console. Each entry provides a model card with capabilities, typical use cases, and pricing details so learners can explore alternatives for their own RAG systems.

```

## Cost tracking: Bedrock calls carry no tags unless you route them through a profile

In the SageMaker episodes we tagged every job at launch because tags never propagate from the notebook. Bedrock is stricter still: **an on-demand `invoke_model` or `converse` call has no tags parameter at all.** If you call `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-...` or `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` by its model ID, the usage lands in the account's Bedrock bill as anonymous per-token charges. The notebook's tags, the bucket's tags, and the tags you set on anything else are irrelevant to it. On a shared account that means nobody can tell which team spent what.

The mechanism Bedrock provides for this is an **application inference profile**: a small, free resource that points at a base model and carries cost allocation tags. You create the profile once, then pass the **profile ARN** instead of the model ID as `modelId` in every call. Usage billed through the profile carries the profile's tags into Cost Explorer. Two details to get right:

- You need **one profile per base model** (the profile is model‑specific), so we create one for the generation model and one for the embedding model.
- Bedrock's tag format uses lowercase `key` / `value`, unlike SageMaker's `Key` / `Value`. The tag *names* (`Name`, `Project`, `Purpose`) stay the same so the Cost Explorer filters line up across services.

The helper below reuses a profile if one with the same name already exists, so re‑running the notebook does not create duplicates.

```python
import re

name = "John Doe"        # replace with your name
project = "sinkorswim"   # replace with your team name
purpose = "RAG-bedrock"

# Bedrock tags are lowercase key/value (SageMaker jobs use Key/Value)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Permissions and verification

- The notebook's execution role needs `bedrock:CreateInferenceProfile`, `bedrock:GetInferenceProfile`, `bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles`, `bedrock:GetFoundationModel`, and `bedrock:TagResource` in addition to `bedrock:InvokeModel`. The `InvokeModel` permission must cover **both** the profile ARN and the underlying model ARN, or calls through the profile are denied. If `create_inference_profile` raises `AccessDeniedException`, ask the account administrator for these permissions rather than falling back to the raw model ID.
- You can confirm the routing in the Bedrock console under **Inference and Assessment → Cross-region inference → Application inference profiles**, or with `bedrock.list_inference_profiles(typeEquals="APPLICATION")`.
- Tags only become filters in Cost Explorer once the tag keys have been **activated as cost allocation tags** in the Billing console (an account‑admin, once‑per‑key action; on a shared workshop account the organizers do this). Until then the tags exist on the resource but do not show up on reports.
- The profile itself has no hourly or storage charge. You only pay per token, exactly as before.

## Run the WattBot evaluation with Bedrock

Now we can loop over all questions in `train_QA.csv`, run retrieval + Bedrock
generation, and write a `wattbot_solutions_bedrock.csv` file.

This mirrors the logic from Episode 02 – the only difference is that the answer
and explanation phases call a hosted Claude 3 model instead of a local Qwen model.

## Wrap‑up: comparing Bedrock to GPU‑based runs

At this point you should have three versions of the WattBot evaluation:

1. **Episode 01 – Notebook GPU instance** using a locally loaded open‑source model.  
2. **Episode 02 – SageMaker Processing job** running the same model in batch with on-demand compute. 
3. **Episode 03 – Bedrock** using a hosted Claude 3 model with per‑token billing.

When deciding between these options in practice:

- Use **Bedrock or other hosted APIs** when:
  - You want to try the latest frontier models quickly.  
  - You only need to run a modest number of questions, or you are still prototyping.  
  - You prefer a simple, token‑based cost model and don’t want to manage GPU capacity.

- Use **self‑hosted models on GPU instances** when:
  - You expect to run large batches repeatedly (e.g., many thousands of questions).  
  - You want tight control over which architectures/checkpoints you run or fine‑tune.  
  - You already have institutional access to cost‑effective on‑prem or cloud GPUs.

The core **RAG evaluation logic stays identical** across all three episodes, which is the main takeaway:
once you have a clean retrieval + normalization pipeline (like WattBot’s), swapping out the generator
is mostly a matter of re‑implementing `answer_phase_for_question` and `explanation_phase_for_question`
for each compute option you care about.


## Concluding remarks: Bedrock models are one piece of the RAG puzzle

In this episode we swapped in Bedrock-hosted models for **both** embedding and
generation. Larger, higher-quality models can definitely help a ton — especially on
messy real-world questions — but it's important to remember that they are still just
**one component** in your RAG system.

- **Bigger or newer models do not magically fix weak retrieval.** If your chunks
  are poorly aligned with the questions, a very strong LLM will still struggle.
- **Most of the long‑term accuracy gains in RAG systems come from the plumbing
  around the LLMs**, including:
  - smarter / semantic chunking strategies
  - good metadata and filtering
  - reranking or multi‑stage retrieval
  - domain‑specific heuristics and post‑processing
- **Cost and latency live in tension with quality.** Larger models (or higher
  token budgets) often improve answers, but at the cost of more inference time
  and higher per‑request spend. Bedrock makes it easier to experiment with that
  tradeoff by switching models without rewriting your pipeline.

As you adapt this notebook to your own projects, treat the LLM choice as **one
tunable component** in a larger system. Iterating on chunking, indexing, and
retrieval policies will almost always give you more headroom than swapping
between already-good models.
