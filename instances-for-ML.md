title: Instances for ML
---

The below table provides general recommendations for selecting AWS instances based on dataset size, computational needs, and cost considerations.

#### Genearl Notes:
- **Minimum RAM** should be at least 1.5X dataset size unless using batch processing (common in deep learning).
- The **m5** and **c5** instances are optimized for CPU-heavy tasks, such as preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training without GPUs.
- **GPU choices** depend on the task (T4 for cost-effective DL, V100/A100 for high performance).
- The **g4dn** instances are cost-effective GPU options, suitable for moderate-scale deep learning tasks.
- The **p3** instances offer high-performance GPU processing, best suited for large deep learning models requiring fast training times.
- **Free Tier Eligibility**: Some smaller instance types, such as `ml.t3.medium`, may be eligible for the AWS Free Tier, which provides limited hours of usage per month. Free Tier eligibility can vary, so check [AWS Free Tier details](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) before launching instances to avoid unexpected costs.
