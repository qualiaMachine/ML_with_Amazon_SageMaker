    "## Step 1: Using a GitHub personal access token (PAT) to push/pull from a SageMaker notebook\n",
    "When working in SageMaker notebooks, you may often need to push code updates to GitHub repositories. However, SageMaker notebooks are typically launched with temporary instances that don’t persist configurations, including SSH keys, across sessions. This makes HTTPS-based authentication, secured with a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), a practical solution. PATs provide flexibility for authentication and enable seamless interaction with both public and private repositories directly from your notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important Note**: Personal access tokens are powerful credentials that grant specific permissions to your GitHub account. To ensure security, only select the minimum necessary permissions and handle the token carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generate a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub\n",
    "1. Go to **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens** on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Click **Generate new token**, select **Classic**.\n",
    "3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., \"SageMaker Access Token\") and set an expiration date if desired for added security.\n",
    "4. **Select the minimum permissions needed**:\n",
    "   - **For public repositories**: Choose only **`public_repo`**.\n",
    "   - **For private repositories**: Choose **`repo`** (full control of private repositories).\n",
    "   - Optional permissions, if needed:\n",
    "     - **`repo:status`**: Access commit status (if checking status checks).\n",
    "     - **`workflow`**: Update GitHub Actions workflows (only if working with GitHub Actions).\n",
    "5. Generate the token and **copy it** (you won’t be able to see it again).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caution**: Treat your PAT like a password. Avoid sharing it or exposing it in your code. Store it securely (e.g., via a password manager like LastPass) and consider rotating it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use `getpass` to prompt for username and PAT\n",
    "The `getpass` library allows you to input your GitHub username and PAT without exposing them in the notebook. This approach ensures you’re not hardcoding sensitive information."

    "## Step 6. Merging local changes with remote/GitHub\n",
    "Our local changes have now been committed, and we can begin the process of mergining with the remoate main branch. Before we try to push our changes, it's good practice to first to a pull. This is critical when working on a collaborate repo with multiple users, so that you don't miss any updates from other team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pull the latest changes from the main branch\n",
    "There are a few different options for pulling the remote code into your local version. The best pull strategy depends on your workflow and the history structure you want to maintain. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Merge (pull.rebase false): Combines the remote changes into your local branch as a merge commit.\n",
    "   - **Use if**: You’re okay with having merge commits in your history, which indicate where you pulled in remote changes. This is the default and is usually the easiest for team collaborations, especially if conflicts arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rebase (pull.rebase true): Replays your local changes on top of the updated main branch, resulting in a linear history.\n",
    "    - **Use if**: You prefer a clean, linear history without merge commits. Rebase is useful if you like to keep your branch history as if all changes happened sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast-forward only (pull.ff only): Only pulls if the local branch can fast-forward to the remote without diverging (no new commits locally).\n",
    "    - **Use if**: You only want to pull updates if no additional commits have been made locally. This can be helpful to avoid unintended merges when your branch hasn’t diverged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended for Most Users\n",
    "If you’re collaborating and want simplicity, **merge (pull.rebase false)** is often the most practical option. This will ensure you get remote changes with a merge commit that captures the history of integration points. For those who prefer a more streamlined history and are comfortable with Git, **rebase (pull.rebase true)** can be ideal but may require more careful conflict handling."
