    "Let's see how to do a similar experiment, but this time using PyTorch neural networks. We will again demonstrate how to test our custom model train script (train_nn.py) before deploying to SageMaker, and discuss some strategies (e.g., using a GPU) for improving train time when needed.\n",

    "### Preparing the data (compressed npz files)\n",
    "When deploying a PyTorch model on SageMaker, it's helpful to prepare the input data in a format that's directly accessible and compatible with PyTorch's data handling methods. The next code cell will prep our npz files from the existing csv versions. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout\n",
    "#### Why are we using this file format? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimized data loading**:  \n",
    "   The `.npz` format stores arrays in a compressed, binary format, making it efficient for both storage and loading. PyTorch can easily handle `.npz` files, especially in batch processing, without requiring complex data transformations during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch compatibility**:  \n",
    "   When training neural networks in PyTorch, it's common to load data in batches. By storing data in an `.npz` file, we can quickly load the entire dataset or specific parts (e.g., `X_train`, `y_train`) into memory and feed it to the PyTorch `DataLoader`, enabling efficient batched data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reduced I/O overhead in SageMaker**:  \n",
    "   Storing data in `.npz` files minimizes the I/O operations during training, reducing time spent on data handling. This is especially beneficial in cloud environments like SageMaker, where efficient data handling directly impacts training costs and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistency and compatibility**:  \n",
    "   Using `.npz` files allows us to ensure consistency between training and validation datasets. Each file (`train_data.npz` and `val_data.npz`) stores the arrays in a standardized way that can be easily accessed by keys (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_val`, `y_val`). This structure is compatible with PyTorch's `Dataset` class, making it straightforward to design custom datasets for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Support for multiple data types**:  \n",
    "   `.npz` files support storage of multiple arrays within a single file. This is helpful for organizing features and labels without additional code. Here, the `train_data.npz` file contains both `X_train` and `y_train`, keeping everything related to training data in one place. Similarly, `val_data.npz` organizes validation features and labels, simplifying file management.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, saving the data in `.npz` files ensures a smooth workflow from data loading to model training in PyTorch, leveraging SageMaker's infrastructure for a more efficient, structured training process.\n",

    "This performance discrepancy might be due to the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small Ddtaset/model size**: When datasets and models are small, the overhead of transferring data between the CPU and GPU, as well as managing the GPU, can actually slow things down. For very small models and datasets, CPUs are often faster since there's minimal data to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GPU initialization overhead**: Every time a training job starts on a GPU, there's a small overhead for initializing CUDA libraries. For short jobs, this setup time can make the GPU appear slower overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch size**: GPUs perform best with larger batch sizes since they can process many data points in parallel. If the batch size is too small, the GPU is underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. You may want to try increasing the batch size to see if this reduces training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instance type**: Some GPU instances, like the `ml.g4dn` series, have less computational power than the larger `p3` series. They're better suited for inference or lightweight tasks rather than intense training, so a more powerful instance (e.g., `ml.p3.2xlarge`) could help for larger tasks.\n",

    "### Distributed training for neural nets: how epochs are managed\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides two main strategies for distributed training: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. Understanding which strategy will be used depends on the model size and the configuration of your SageMaker training job, as well as the default settings of the specific SageMaker Estimator you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Data parallelism (most common for mini-batch SGD)**\n",
    "   - **How it works**: In data parallelism, each instance in the cluster (e.g., multiple `ml.m5.xlarge` instances) maintains a **complete copy of the model**. The **training dataset is split across instances**, and each instance processes a different subset of data simultaneously. This enables multiple instances to complete forward and backward passes on different data batches independently.\n",
    "   - **Epoch distribution**: Even though each instance processes all the specified epochs, they only work on a portion of the dataset for each epoch. After each batch, instances synchronize their gradient updates across all instances using a method such as *all-reduce*. This ensures that while each instance is working with a unique data batch, the model weights remain consistent across instances.\n",
    "   - **Key insight**: Because all instances process the specified number of epochs and synchronize weight updates between batches, each instance's training contributes to a cohesive, shared model. The **effective epoch count across instances appears to be shared** because data parallelism allows each instance to handle a fraction of the data per epoch, not the epochs themselves. Data parallelism is well-suited for models that can fit into a single instance's memory and benefit from increased data throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Model parallelism (best for large models)**\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Model parallelism divides the model itself across multiple instances, not the data. This approach is best suited for very large models that cannot fit into a single GPU or instance's memory (e.g., large language models).\n",
    "   - **Epoch distribution**: The model is partitioned so that each instance is responsible for specific layers or components. Data flows sequentially through these partitions, where each instance processes a part of each batch and passes it to the next instance.\n",
    "   - **Key insight**: This approach is more complex due to the dependency between model components, so **synchronization occurs across the model layers rather than across data batches**. Model parallelism generally suits scenarios with exceptionally large model architectures that exceed memory limits of typical instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining which distributed training strategy is used\n",
    "SageMaker will select the distributed strategy based on:\n",
    "   - **Framework and Estimator configuration**: Most deep learning frameworks in SageMaker default to data parallelism, especially when using PyTorch or TensorFlow with standard configurations.\n",
    "   - **Model and data size**: If you specify a model that exceeds a single instance's memory capacity, SageMaker may switch to model parallelism if configured for it.\n",
    "   - **Instance count**: When you specify `instance_count > 1` in your Estimator with a deep learning model, SageMaker will use data parallelism by default unless explicitly configured for model parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "You observed that each instance ran all epochs with `instance_count=2` and 10,000 epochs, which aligns with data parallelism. Here, each instance processed the full set of epochs independently, but each batch of data was different, and the gradient updates were synchronized across instances.\n",

    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient data handling**: The `.npz` format is optimized for efficient loading, reducing I/O overhead and enabling batch compatibility for PyTorchâ€™s `DataLoader`.\n",
    "- **GPU training**: While beneficial for larger models or datasets, GPUs may introduce overhead for smaller tasks; selecting the right instance type is critical for cost-efficiency.\n",
    "- **Data parallelism vs. model parallelism**: Data parallelism splits data across instances and synchronizes model weights, suitable for typical neural network tasks. Model parallelism, which divides model layers, is ideal for very large models that exceed memory capacity.\n",
    "- **SageMaker configuration**: By adjusting instance counts and types, SageMaker supports scalable training setups. Starting with CPU training and scaling as needed with GPUs or distributed setups allows for performance optimization.\n",
    "- **Testing locally first**: Before deploying large-scale training in SageMaker, test locally with a smaller setup to ensure code correctness and efficient resource usage.\n",
